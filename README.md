# Booking-Analysis
I am excited to share my latest project, which involves an in-depth analysis of booking data, covering data preprocessing, EDA, customer segmentation, time-series forecasting, and interactive dashboard development.

Key Highlights:
ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, standardized text fields, and converted date/time formats.
ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering: Extracted booking months, categorized peak hours, and cleaned customer data.
ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified booking trends, revenue distribution, and service popularity using Seaborn & Matplotlib.
ðŸ”¹ Customer Segmentation: Applied K-Means clustering to classify customers based on spending and booking frequency.
ðŸ”¹ Time-Series Forecasting: Implemented ARIMA to predict future bookings for business optimization.
ðŸ”¹ Interactive Dashboard: Developed a Dash & Plotly web app to visualize revenue trends and booking insights dynamically.

Deliverables:
ðŸ“Œ Cleaned Dataset (cleaned_booking_data.csv)
ðŸ“Œ Automated EDA Report (booking_report.html)
ðŸ“Œ Interactive Dashboard for data exploration

This project provides valuable insights into booking patterns, revenue trends, and customer behavior, helping businesses optimize pricing, service offerings, and marketing strategies.
